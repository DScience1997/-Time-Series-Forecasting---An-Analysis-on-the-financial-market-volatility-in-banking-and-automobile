# Comparison of GARCH and Data Science Models in Financial Times Series Forecasting: An analysis for the financial market volatility in the banking and automobile industry
Volatility is commonly used in financial investment to gauge the dispersion of asset returns over time. In statistics, volatility is calculated as either a standard deviation or variance of price returns. Volatility rises as the risk of a financial asset increases. Investors/traders can use such information to distinguish between low-risk and high-risk assets. (Bee Guan , 2021) 

In this paper, we try to compare the performance of GARCH models with data science models by trying to forecast returns of 4 companies. The objective is to find the model that gives the best result in the case of a very high volatility. Indeed, we have chosen to compare the evolution of returns between the German and American markets in 2 different industries, namely: - The banking sector by comparing Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) and Bank of America Corp (BAC) - The automotive industry by comparing BMW and Ford Motors The machine learning models we have chosen to make this comparison are: - GARCH o ARCH, GARCH, GARCH-t, E-GARCH and GJR-GARCH. - Data Science Models o LSTM and Random Forest.
